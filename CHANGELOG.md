## [1.0.1] - 2025-11-15
### 🛠️ Changed
- Styles are now served as a separate CSS file (`dist/tv-pagination.css`) generated by Vite during the build process.
- Users must now explicitly import the stylesheet in their application:
  - For Vue/Vite SPA: `import '@todovue/tv-pagination/style.css'` in `main.ts`
  - For Nuxt 3/4: Add `'@todovue/tv-pagination/style.css'` to the `css` array in `nuxt.config.ts`

### ✨ Added
- Added `sideEffects` field to `package.json` to support proper tree-shaking with CSS files.
- Added `./style.css` export path in `package.json` for explicit CSS imports.
- Improved SSR/SSG compatibility, especially for Nuxt 3/4 applications.

### 📦 Dependencies
- Removed dependency on `vite-plugin-css-injected-by-js` from `devDependencies`

## [1.0.0] - 2025-11-09
### ✨ Added
* First stable version of the `TvPagination` component.
* Automatic calculation of total pages (`totalItems` + `pageSize`).
* Dynamic range with `siblingCount` and `boundaryCount`.
* Conditional left/right ellipsis rendering.
* Optional buttons: first/last (`showFirstLast`) and previous/next (`showPrevNext`).
* Navigation icon support (`showIcons`).
* Customizable styles for active and inactive pages (`activeStyle`, `inactiveStyle`).
* Propagation of `buttonProps` to each internal `TvButton`.
* `page-label` slot to customize each page’s label.
* Controlled API through `v-model` (syncs `modelValue`).
* Emission of `update:modelValue` and `change` events only on actual page changes.
* Invalid range protection (min/max normalization in watcher and composable).
* Global disabled state (`disabled`).
* Configurable accessible label (`ariaLabel`) and `aria-current` on active page.
* Built as ES/CJS library with types (`vite-plugin-dts`).
* Automatic injection of compiled SCSS styles (via `vite-plugin-css-injected-by-js`).
* Prepared for SSR environments (no direct DOM access).
